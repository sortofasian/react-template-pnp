# Create React App based template

This template was bootstrapped from Create React App via yarn.
This repo uses yarn to enable a zero-install workflow - just `git clone` then `yarn start`
Zero-install requires yarn v2 or later. The recommended way to install yarn is via `corepack enable`, which will allow you to use yarn straight away. If you're using asdf for Node.js, you will need to run `asdf reshim nodejs` afterwards.
